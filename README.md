## Main Concepts
### Concurrency
**Concurrency** in Go refers to the ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, using goroutines and tools like WaitGroups and channels to synchronize and communicate between them.
### Goroutine
**Goroutine** is an independently executing function, launched by go statement.
### Channel
A **channel** in Go provides a connection between two goroutines, allowing them to communicate.
